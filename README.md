# Funkhaus Auto SEO

Automatically implement SEO best practices using the power of AI.

## Features

1. Converts PNG images to JPG (only if no transparency found)
1. Saves the primary color of the image
1. Automatically changes the filename to tags of the image (requires API key)
1. Automatically caption the image (requires API key)
1. Automatically set the focal point of the image (requires API key), allows user override.

## Usage

1. Instal this plugin into WordPress. Works best along with [fuxt-backend](https://github.com/funkhaus/fuxt-backend). Be sure to install the ACF custom fields that fuxt-backend requires.
1. Under "Settings > Auto SEO" you need to enter an API key. Contact Funkhaus to purchase one.
1. Upload an image and notice how it auto sets the caption and focal points.
1. Click on the small focal point circle, and drag to the focal point. That's it, it saves automatically.

## TODO

1. Use this for focal point detect? Maybe as no-API fallback? https://github.com/xymak/smartcrop.php
1. Add "Settings" link to the plugin install page
